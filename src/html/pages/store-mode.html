                        As Senior UX Designer, I helped deliver Target&rsquo;s Store Mode MVP, a mobile-first in-store digital experience focused on utility and navigation. The goal was to empower shoppers to easily find products, get help, and navigate the store using their mobile device, bridging the gap between physical and digital shopping.

                    Target observed that 15% of app reviews referenced a desire for contextually-aware in-store features. Although guests frequently turned to the app while shopping, core in-store functionality was limited. The Store Mode MVP aimed to solve this problem by creating a seamless, intuitive experience that enhanced store visits while driving key business outcomes like repeat usage and increased basket size.

                    Initial shopper insights were gathered during a company hackathon, where guests provided direct feedback on interactive prototypes. Of several concepts tested, guests gravitated toward a map-based navigation tool to help locate products in-store. This insight informed the foundation of the three-layer framework:

                    The framework leveraged mental models from native map platforms (Apple Maps, Google Maps) to ensure familiarity and ease of use. My role was to evolve early designs into a scalable, utility-driven experience, balancing intuitive interactions with moments of product discovery.

                    One major challenge was deciding what, if anything, to surface on the initial landing map. I advocated for launching with a blank map, opting not to assume shopper intent with preloaded content like deals or shopping list items (which had historically low engagement).

                    While this non-intrusive approach respected user autonomy, post-launch research revealed that shoppers desired more guidance on first use—a valuable learning for future iterations.

                    The MVP saw immediate traction:

                <ul>
                    <li>62% of shoppers reused Store Mode within 7 days of initial use</li>
                    <li>Basket sizes increased by 37% when Store Mode was used during shopping</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Beyond quantitative metrics, our research team conducted post-launch shop-alongs and usability tests. These revealed that Store Mode's entry point was not as visible as intended, and that bolder, more interruptive design treatments may be needed for future discovery.

                    Following a successful MVP launch, we identified three key areas for iteration:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Improve discovery and visibility of Store Mode entry points</li>

                    <li>Explore new product assortments that foster discovery while shopping in store</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The MVP proved that context-aware design can deepen engagement and boost purchase behavior. With a solid foundation in place, future work will focus on evolving the experience into a core part of Target's omnichannel ecosystem.
