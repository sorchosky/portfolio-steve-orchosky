                    <p>The core relationship between Icon Marketing and Tempur-Pedic is to support Tempur-Pedic&rsquo;s retail network with any and all of their marketing needs. One component of this is to create web pages to showcase the brand and products offered by each retailer. These pages serve as landing pages for co-branded digital banner ads and eblasts between the retailer and Tempur-Pedic.</p>
                    <p>Through my employment at Icon, working on brand page creative was a majority of my job. When I arrived, the brand page creation process ended at delivering artwork via PDFs or PSD files to retailers, who then would ideally need to find a developer that can build the page to our specs on their website. The reality was that the outsourcing developers left Icon out of the loop, so there was nobody to ensure the website was built to brand standards. Much like in a game of telephone, this meant the final developed version of my brand pages varied greatly in development quality, if developed at all.</p>
