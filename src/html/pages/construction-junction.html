                <p>When researching an app design concept for Construction Junction, our initial goal was to create a customer-facing application that would create a remote way for customers to browse products. To first understand the brand and company mission, our team first looked at the website and social media and created a Tone of Voice model as a means of objectively creating for the brand.</p>
                <p>We based our assessment on Nielsen Norman Group&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tone-of-voice-dimensions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Four Dimensions of Tone of Voice.</a></p>

                <p>We were surprised to learn of many different volunteer initiatives that Construction Junction supports, such as a Goodwill Job Training Partnership, to help people with barriers to employment to help get work experience. However, this also revealed that there was a fairly high rate of churn among volunteers. Knowing this, we set our sights on creating a mobile volunteer assistant.</p>
