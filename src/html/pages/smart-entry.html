                        With my team at frog, I partnered with a client in the home goods space to create a proprietary “Smart Entry” system for Home Owners. I led the design of a functional mid-fidelity mobile app controller, which I was later responsible for evolving into a high-fidelity mobile prototype. I also contributed to establishing and documenting interaction design patterns with the physical door, led 3 user research initiatives, and facilitated multiple remote workshops to gather product requirements and establish a feature roadmap.

                    Our client reached out to frog with the goal of creating the first all-inclusive &ldquo;Smart Entry&rdquo; system. This brief was established because of market pressure from a competitor, Masonite, who recently release a Smart Door in partnership with Ring and Yale. Our client sought to create their own Smart Entry system that didn&rsquo;t feel modular and could be offered as an all-in-one proprietary product.

                    After establishing user stories, I believed that translating the user stories into storyboards would the best way to communicate requirements to the larger tech team. Given the amount of variability in sensor inputs and feedback the door needed to produce, I realized that storyboarding was not an appropriate way of communicating both the story of usage and the product interactions simultaneously.

                    I changed tactics to instead create two complementary documents. The first was a journey map showing how users flow between different proximity zones around the door over time. The second was a lexicon of Door Modes and Door Events, highlighting the expected inputs and feedback from the Smart Entry during use. By bundling the 11 component signals into modes and states, I could communicate easily with the prototyping team what feedback should be expected from the door at a given.

Each session was formatted with a semi-structured interview introduction, a usability test with 2-4 workflows, and a closing reflection interview.
