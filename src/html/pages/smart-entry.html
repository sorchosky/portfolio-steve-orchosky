                        With my team at frog, I partnered with a client in the home goods space to create a proprietary “Smart Entry” system for Home Owners. I led the design of a functional mid-fidelity mobile app controller, which I was later responsible for evolving into a high-fidelity mobile prototype. I also contributed to establishing and documenting interaction design patterns with the physical door, led 3 user research initiatives, and facilitated multiple remote workshops to gather product requirements and establish a feature roadmap.

                    Our client reached out to frog with the goal of creating the first all-inclusive &ldquo;Smart Entry&rdquo; system. This brief was established because of market pressure from a competitor, Masonite, who recently release a Smart Door in partnership with Ring and Yale. Our client sought to create their own Smart Entry system that didn&rsquo;t feel modular and could be offered as an all-in-one proprietary product.

                    After establishing user stories, I first believed that translating the user stories into storyboards would the best way to visualize requirements. Given the amount of variability in sensor inputs and feedback the door needed to produce, I realized that storyboarding was not an appropriate way of communicating both the story of usage and the product interactions simultaneously.

                <p>
                    I changed tactics to instead create two complementary documents. The first was a journey map showing how users flow between different proximity zones around the door over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second was a lexicon of Door Modes and Door Events, highlighting the expected inputs and feedback from the Smart Entry during use. By bundling the 11 component signals into modes and states, I could communicate easily with the prototyping team what feedback should be expected from each component of the door at a given time.

                    From this workshop, we created a document organizing how each could (or should) be delivered to a user. This informed how different notification types should be delivered (such as push notification, text, email summary), as well as an in-app activity feed.

                    As I was working to improve key interaction patterns that we identified in user testing, I was also collaborating with a visual designer on the look and feel of the app. With the client&rsquo;s openness to our recommendation on branding, we created a visual look that emulated the physical control panel on the Smart Entry, but introduced interactions that were purely digital to enhance the user experience.

                    At the conclusion of this project, our team handed off high-fidelity interaction flows to demonstrate seven workflows that we considered high-frequency use cases. If I were to continue this project, I would want to continue designing from our backlog of additional user epics (i.e. offboarding/moving, interacting with multiple doors, and multi-space management) that would have been exciting to pursue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I would plan to work closely with design technology to create a high-fidelity component library. This way we could implement the new look into the functional mobile prototype so we could test a more realistic experience with the Smart Entry prototype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of this project, we delivered a concept that the client team was very excited to implement. Overall, I&rsquo;m very proud of this work and I learned a lot around designing for iOT products, conducting usability testing remote and in-person, and collaborating with product, visual design, and technology.
