                    <p>COVID-19 swiftly and drastically changed the modern workplace since 2020. One common misconception around the rapid transition to Work-From-Home was that people that work primarily on laptops would be the easiest to adapt. This type of employee, broadly labeled Information Workers, uses theoretical and analytical knowledge to create products and services. However, the lack of coworker presence and shortcomings of 2-D tools leaves much to be desired to truly emulate the workplace.</p>

                    <p>In addition to secondary research, I co-led a Semi-Structured interview initiative with my HCI teammate Gabbi. Our goal with these interviews was to understand how Information Workers viewed their work, with emphasis on their transition to remote work.</p>
                    <!-- Pilot interview protocol -->
                    <p>When conducting three initial pilot interviews, we realized that our broad interview protocol combined with the variety of different interviewees that fell under the definition of Information Worker resulted in unactionable and disparate data. We decided to pivot to a Diary Study with the hope that we could get more specific information.</p>
                    <!-- Diary Study Process Model -->
                    <p>In this new research plan, we asked recruits to take notes over their next three cross-functional meetings around how they collaborate and what they felt was either a benefit or a hindrance to the specific meeting.</p>

                    <p>Shortly after completing our Diary Study, we received a comprehensive research report from Microsoft. This document validated our prior insights, and also outlined five customer segments that specified the different qualities of Information Workers. </p>

                    <p>This document also contained eight potential solution ideas that our sponsor encouraged us to explore.

                    <p>We created storyboards from these ideas to convey user scenarios, which we ran by our sponsor for review. We then evaluated the storyboards favoring the two criteria that started our project:</p>

                        <li>When does the presence of others matter the most?</li>

                    <p>This project was an exciting introduction into Mixed Reality for me, and it was a real pleasure getting to collaborate with Microsoft. Since this project occurred in early 2021, we had an ironic challenge where our team was struggling with and trying to solve remote collaboration. While this validated our problem space, research and design moved a little slower than we had expected.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, our team had logistic trouble getting VR devices, and as a result we lost valuable time at the end of the project that was initially reserved for user testing and feedback. This was when I proposed another round of storyboards for our mid-fidelity prototype while other members of the team worked to get headsets. I still believe this was a productive way of getting team alignment, but if I could redo the process I would have pushed to use our budget to get VR devices earlier so we could have done this stage in a 3D medium.</p>
                    <p>Overall, I&rsquo;m very pleased with the work our team did. The project gave me experience collaborating with business and technical experts, and allowed for a lot of fluctuation between leading research &amp; design initiatives and learning from my peers.</p>
