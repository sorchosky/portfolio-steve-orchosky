                    <p>In our final project of User-Centered Research and Evaluation (UCRE) during my first semester at CMU, our class was partnered with the Kelly Strayhorn Theater to do research based on predefined prompts. Our team decided to tackle the prompt “How might we encourage people to engage with others unlike themselves in order to create shared understanding?” Supported by over six individual research sessions, our team created Dance Dance Revelation, a way for performance artists to lower barriers into art to novice dance performance attendees through real-time discussion questions and prompts.</p>
                    <p>The biggest challenge we had to overcome as a team was to adapt and conduct all research virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While this initially was viewed as an obstacle, our team was optimistic and reframed the situation to find a lot of opportunities to utilize new digital tools and connect to participants online.</p>

                    <p>The Kelly Strayhorn Theater (KST) is a performing arts theater in East Liberty, Pittsburgh. Once a bustling commercial center, East Liberty fell into decline in the 60s and 70s due to redlining and residents moving to the suburbs. While the neighborhood has been making a comeback the past couple decades, many Pittsburgh residents view the neighborhood as unsafe to visit. This, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in a huge decline in public engagement with performing arts.</p>

                    <p>As part of a class project for User-Centered Research and Evaluation (UCRE) during my Master&rsquo;s at Carnegie Mellon, our class formed teams to research ways to support the theater. Specifically, we sought to find ways in which KST can continue their mission of bringing diverse communities together through creative expression leveraging online or pandemic-compliant measures.</p>

                    <p>Our project kicked off with a Q&amp;A session with Joseph Hall, the general manager of KST, to learn more about the theater&rsquo;s background. In addition, we were provided with client data based on website metrics and ticket sales to help establish a baseline for current engagement. After cleaning and labeling the data, I was responsible for visualizing the data used Excel and Tableau.</p>

                    <p>Throughout all data we had available, we discovered that most first-time attendees find events through word-of-mouth. However, during Spring of 2020 we noticed that Social Media and Press have become more effective avenues for reaching first-time attendees to KST events. Another insight that we pulled from the data confirmed that music and dance are the most popular event categories. This was interesting to our group since we were not familiar with KST, but seemed to align with the brand and talent affiliated with the theater.</p>

                    <p>As part of a class exercise before this project, we individually conducted think-aloud studies on KST&rsquo;s website, so we already had some insights around its usability. For our first research exercise as a team, we conducted think-aloud studies on a local competitor, the Pittsburgh Public Theater (PPT), to discover underlying needs that could be applied to Pittsburgh performing arts organizations as a whole. We asked our participants to perform three tasks:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <blockquote class="col-12 col-md-4">Find an event that you would be interested in attending.</blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="col-12 col-md-4">Choose a restaurant partnered with the theater that you would like to eat at before a show.</blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="col-12 col-md-4">List two ways that you can help the theater.</blockquote>
                </div>
                <div class="col-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">
                    <p>Upon completing the study, our most critical finding is that the website under-emphasizes how participants can register for an online performance, a similar issue as KST. This was evident with all of our participants, including a frequent PPT theater-goer that hasn’t seen an online performance during the pandemic due to this difficulty. Second, we notice most participants would not be incentivized enough to donate, and that there are no noticeable ways to volunteer. Finally, when asked about restaurants partners, we discover that participants prioritize relative location to the theater and that partnerships were underemphasized.</p>

                    <p>To continue to understand how people engage with media at home, we began to design a Contextual Inquiry session. For this research, we found four participants that were willing to let us join them while they engaged with media as they would naturally at home. We conducted sessions through Zoom using screen sharing and while watching media over a streaming service. While watching, we asked questions around how they typically engage with media to learn more about their ideal environment, time of day, and other features that help to enhance their experience. Each session lasted approximately one hour.</p>
                    <p>After each inquiry, our team got together for an interpretation session, where we wrote down over 20 insights for each participant about how they engage with media at home. With over 80 insights, plus our notes from prior research sessions, we were at a great place to start synthesizing data into potential innovation opportunities.</p>

From this, we made a list of themes to work with to develop our initial ideas. For our first round of idea generation, we used Crazy 8's to create a 32 distinct solutions among the whole team, and as a way quickly get the 'obvious' ideas out in the open.</p>

                    <blockquote class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-3">I want to easily find what the show is about</blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-3">I want to talk to other people while watching the show and see what they are seeing and feeling</blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-3">I want to do other things while watching a show (eating, texting, cooking, etc.)</blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-3">I have a limited amount of time to watch shows, so they need to fit to my schedule</blockquote>
                </div>
                <p class="col-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">With these ideas in mind, each team member took a user need and generated 3 storyboards with varying level of risk (low, medium, and high). We utilized these to conduct an exercise called <strong>speed dating</strong>. In this exercise, we recruited participants to preview our storyboards in three to five minute intervals to explore their initial reactions and uncover any user needs that we may not have picked up from our interpretation sessions. This exercise was done with a facilitator and a recorder for notes.</p>

We compiled this into a dataset to score each of the ideas.</p>

We decided to pursue 2B Trivia Game because it received a high average ranking, was in the strongest user need category, and was a prompt our team was passionate about exploring into a prototype.</p>

                    <p>Using our storyboard as a reference, we first created wireframes for an interactive trivia game. We learned during our Contextual Inquiry sessions that viewers are comfortable viewing media on a large device while using a smaller screen for communicating with others. To build on this, we designed a low-fi experience prototype that incorporated a performance over Zoom with pop-up questions, and a mobile trivia interface.</p>
                    <figure class="my-5">

                        <figcaption>Experience Prototype | Iteration 1</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>We tested this concept with classmates for viability, and through feedback learned that the pop-up questions were taking too much screen real estate. In our second iteration, we used smaller prompts on the large screen, and built out additional questions to simulate a more complete trivia session. We also sourced a video of a dance performance from KST’s Facebook page to give the prototype a little more context.</p>
                    <figure class="my-5">

                        <figcaption>Experience Prototype | Iteration 2</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>We recruited four participants to test the second iteration and noticed something interesting—our prototype was having an adverse effect from our goal. Our participants felt disconnected from the performance with the two-screen setup. Additionally, our participants were not frequent theater-goers, and they didn't feel they were connecting with others because they were guessing at questions related to the performance.</p>
                    <p>To meet these concerns, we took another look at our prototype and instead approached the trivia as a way to engage with the performance production team. By having the production team providing discussion prompts, we create an opening for first-time theater attendees to hold discussions with peers and performing artists that they would have felt isolated from in a formal performance art setting. An important part of this new experience is that questions do not have wrong answers, but are simply ways to foster discussion about how art impacts everyone uniquely.</p>

                <p class="col-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">At our third iteration of our experience prototype, we were ready to share our work with KST. As part of our presentation, we developed an elevator pitch and poster which we would present to KST and guests during a virtual poster session. In this session, our team was assigned a dedicated breakout room on Zoom where guests could come and go to hear our pitch and ask questions about our solution. We titled our work Dance Dance Revelation as a nod to KST's thriving dance community, even though our solution could be adapted to many genres of work.</p>

                        <blockquote>&ldquo;After talking to the Kelly Strayhorn Theater we found that the biggest area of opportunity for KST is keeping audience members feeling connected in a remote environment. We addressed this by priming new theater-goers while watching prerecorded content with questions about the theater. This will allow them to learn more about the performances and discuss them in a way that really speaks to their desire to engage with others remotely.&rdquo;</blockquote>

                <p class="col-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">We presented to a few guests, including one member of KST's media production team. While we advocated for branded captions to support the theater, we suggested using YouTube captions as a low-effort way to continue testing the idea with audiences. Additionally, we engaged in discussions about whether on-screen captions were distracting to more-experienced performing art attendees. We stressed that this would be an opt-in feature specifically targeting newer performance attendees.</p>

                    <p>This course was one of the primary reasons why I had decided to apply for my Master's in Human-Computer Interaction. I really enjoyed learning and applying all the research methods that we engaged with in User-Centered Research & Evaluation. This course showed me the value in not rushing to solutions before you take time to understand the problem and areas of opportunity. By applying a myriad of different research methods, I feel like our team looked at the opportunity space from all angles to help support our design solution.</p>
