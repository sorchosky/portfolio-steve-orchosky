                    <p>US Playing Card is the parent company of many different playing card brands, most notably Bicycle cards. For this project, I was responsible for a brand exploration, as well as designing and developing a Wordpress website for them during my employment at Icon Marketing. Their goal was twofold: to tell the story and history of the USPC and to connect with casinos via articles and trade shows. Shortly after this website went live, the U.S. Playing Card Company was acquired by Cartamundi, an international board and card game manufacturer based out of Belgium.</p>

                    <p>The United States Playing Card Company was created in 1876 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Much of the company&rsquo;s effort has been directed toward their flagship brand, Bicycle Cards. Today, USPC has over 150 years of history and over 10 different card brands under its name.</p>
                    <p>However, it was clear that there were no brand assets or visual direction for USPC other than the logo and occasional use of Gotham as a &lsquo;brand font.&rsquo; The first goal of this project was to solidify a visual identity, spanning from establishing a visual style, information architecture, and the website design.</p>

We agreed that the homepage should focus on brands, with easy access to historical and casino-based content.</p>

                    <h5>Moodboards as a client touchpoint</h5>
                    <p>In previous projects I&rsquo;ve worked on, a moodboard was typically and internal tool used to get buy-in with creative directors. Since the USPC team had experience working with marketing both internally and externally, our moodboard became an important touchpoint going into the website design.</p>
                    <h5>Gutenberg offers the flexibility of newer website builders</h5>
                    <p>This project was my first chance to develop a website using Wordpress&rsquo;s new (at the time) Gutenberg content framework for theme development. I was very impressed by the flexibility it offers clients, however with this came lots of new considerations for what components on a website should or shouldnâ€™t be client editable.</p>
