While the assignment was to create a customer-facing app, our research showed greater value through instead creating an employee inventory management system that allows for easy cataloging of new donation items.</p>

                    <p>When researching an app design concept for Construction Junction, our initial goal was to create a customer-facing application that would create a remote way for customers to browse products. To first understand the brand and company mission, our team first looked at the website and social media and created a Tone of Voice model as a means of objectively creating for the brand.</p>
                    <p>We based our assessment on Nielsen Norman Group&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tone-of-voice-dimensions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Four Dimensions of Tone of Voice.</a></p>

                    <figcaption>With a focus on community, two of the standout traits we discovered for public media were to show Construction Junction as &lsquo;casual&rsquo; and &lsquo;enthusiastic&rsquo;</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <div class="col-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">
                    <p>As part of our research, our team also created a stakeholder map. We wanted to learn about all of the key players and understand if there was a specific segment that we wanted to focus on when creating our app.</p>

                <div class="col-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">
                    <p>We were surprised to learn of many different volunteer initiatives that Construction Junction supports, such as a Goodwill Job Training Partnership, to help people with barriers to employment to help get work experience. However, this also revealed that there was a fairly high rate of churn among volunteers. Knowing this, we set our sights on creating a mobile volunteer assistant.</p>

        <!-- Low Fidelity Prototyping -->

                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="col-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Our team took a distributed parallel prototyping approach at the low-fidelity stage. Each of us made a separate wireframe of our own vision for the app, resulting in four examples that we could compare and contrast.</p>
            <!-- Collage of low-fi wireframes -->
            <figure>
                <figcaption>My initial sketches for a user flow of cataloging new inventory donations</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="col-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Based on our team critique and through user testing with other classmates, we decided that inventory cataloging and management was the biggest area to add value for volunteers. We combined our approaches and established a single user flow that focused on cataloging.</p>
            <!-- Final low-fi user flow -->
            <figure>
                <figcaption>We cut and pasted the most effective pieces of each of our four directions</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="col-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">We next began digitizing our sketches in Figma. To maximize efficiency, we leveraged design patterns from our team’s collective experiences with other apps to inspire how to lay out some different features.</p>
            <!-- Category mid-fi next to Door Dash -->
            <figure>
                <figcaption>The category filters at the top of the Inventory page were inspired by DoorDash’s homepage food category menu.</figcaption>

            </figure>
            <p class="col-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Refining the low fidelity prototype and critique in class raised a lot of questions around the types of access that volunteers should have access to versus full time employees. Critique also encouraged questions around what data needs to be captured as new donations are processed, such as potential damages of used objects.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="col-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">Once our mid fidelity designs were in place, we began discussing how to include color and brand into the design. In our design for class, we created a colorful interface that emulated the paint texture from their website and social media.</p>
            <!-- Screenshot of final submitted design frames -->

            </figure>
            <p class="col-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">When designing our high fidelity, we broke the user flow of our mid-fidelity design into four sections. I was responsible for the Inventory landing screen and Item Review. As we were working, we leveraged Figma&rsquo;s Color and Text Styles for consistency.</p>
            <p class="col-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">However, for many UI elements, we were copying and pasting from each others’ work. This made it challenging for individuals to make edits that could be applied consistently across the entire app. While it was time consuming, repeated viewing of the prototype made slight alignment errors apparent, and we created one cohesive prototype design which we could pitch to the class.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="col-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">After the project, I reflected on how this process could have been improved. About a month after the project, I learned at Config 2021 how robust the variable components can be when creating a design system for a mobile application. I realized that not using these components properly was creating barriers to quicker iteration.</p>

            </figure>
            <p class="col-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">In my redesign, I took an Atomic Design approach by starting with the smallest components I knew I would need and working my way up to more complex components and layouts.</p>

            </figure>
            <p class="col-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">I used this system to create a new version of the high fidelity prototype. Since this was a new project I would take on solo, I also used this chance to put my own take on the brand, simplifying to a utility-focus since this would be an employee-facing tool instead of a public interface.</p>
