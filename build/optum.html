                        For my Master of Human-Computer Interaction capstone project, my team Well21 partnered with Optum to design Boulevard, a versatile mobile application and design system for holistic patient care. As a previous COVID-19 return-to-work symptom checking app was in the process of being deprecated, our team&rsquo;s goal pivoted to create a digital product to assist with patient care regardless of disease or injury condition.

                        Through the project, I led the creation of the Boulevard design system, mobile product design, and brand identity for our team and product. I also mentored and art directed for my team through iterative prototypes, client presentations, and reports. Additionally, was a contributing writer, researcher, and project manager.

                    In the beginning of our capstone project, our initial project brief was to conceptualize a potential future for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.weprotectwell.com/">ProtectWell</a>, an app for employers to monitor COVID rates across employees as they return to the office. While most of our early research focused on infectious disease mitigation, we worked with our sponsors at Optum to open the scope in a way that understands the interplay between multiple disease and injury conditions.

                    By looking at health through a broader lens, our team could draw patterns around how patients view recovery from seemingly disparate diseases and injuries. Our team created Boulevard as a platform approach to helping patients manage their at-home care plan in a way that acknowledges all aspects of them as a patient regardless of their condition.

                    In our Spring semester for this project, we designed and conducted nine user-centered research studies to understand health, wellness, and recovery from the patient&rsquo;s point of view. This research informed six insights which we developed into three core values that would drive our design solution:

                    A few sequential events happened from this point that shaped our design direction for the rest of the project. The first was the prevalence of vaccine distribution in the U.S., which welcomingly created a sharp drop in engagement for ProtectWell. This ultimately led to ProtectWell announcing that they were being dissolved into other product teams at Optum, and gave our team encouragement to explore beyond just COVID-19 to see where our research would apply.

                    We realized ProtectWell wasn&rsquo;t designed to aid with recovery when someone contracts the disease. This piqued our curiosity, so we started to explore recovery apps on the market and found that there weren’t any solutions that aided in at-home recovery and were backed by a large healthcare organization such as UnitedHealth Group.

                    For this map to hold true, we were eager to test it by focusing on a very divergent patient pool from an infectious disease. We decided on soft tissue recovery patients because of their length of recovery time, high frequency of patients with readmissions, and value to Optum.

                    With eight weeks left in the project, our Summer semester focused on research through design, while concurrently developing a high-fidelity design to hand off to our clients. We conducted four sprints based on different themes that we co-created with our client sponsors.

                    To address these themes, we adapted Google Ventures&rsquo; Sprint Model into a two week format. The first week would map a customer journey, rapidly generate ideas, isolate the highest risk-reward design opportunity, and build a prototype to test while recruiting participants. The second week was three days of testing with real patients, followed by synthesis and documentation of what to move into the high-fidelity prototype.

                    With the findings from our individual sprints, I created two high-fidelity interactive mobile prototypes for our client to use. The first and more in-depth focused on an ACL tear patient, Sarah, who is halfway through her recovery journey. The second is the same UI applied for a COVID patient to track and monitor their symptoms.

                    Our goal for the team brand was to create an identity that could fit within the Optum service ecosystem, but not limit us too early into the project. Additionally, we wanted the brand to quickly convey our partnership with ProtectWell when talking with other experts in Optum, so our brand needed to complement their visual style.
